# Complete Story: The Mystery of the Missing Acorns

## Story Summary

One autumn morning, Grey Squirrel discovers that his acorn stash has disappeared. His friend White Rabbit, playing detective, comes to help. They find a mysterious rainbow feather that leads them to Olivia the Owl, the wise one of the forest.

Olivia examines the feather and shares a riddle that leads them to an enchanted clearing. There, they discover a second magical feather and follow a rainbow-colored ladybug. This ladybug guides them to Carlos the Coati, who had taken the acorns to make himself a cozy nest.

The story ends happily: Carlos apologizes, and all the friends help each other share the acorns and build comfortable homes for winter.
